Project Name: Medical Document Extraction, Standardization, and Fraud Detection

Project Description:

This project aims to develop a system to extract and standardize medical documents from a variety of providers and customers, and to detect potential fraudulent claims. The system will use a combination of machine learning and rule-based techniques to process a large volume of medical documents and identify patterns and inconsistencies that may indicate fraud.

Project Goals:

Extract and standardize medical documents from a variety of providers and customers.
Identify similarities among document templates, even if there are minor modifications.
Flag potentially fraudulent claims using similar templates with customer detail modifications.
Implement the system as a web service or a standalone application that can be integrated with existing medical record systems.
Project Architecture:

The system will be implemented as a microservices architecture, with each service performing a specific task, such as template extraction, template comparison, fraud detection, and post-processing. The microservices will be deployed in a containerized environment, such as Kubernetes, to ensure scalability and reliability.

Project Technologies:

The following technologies will be used to develop and implement the system:

Programming languages: Python
Machine learning frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
Natural language processing (NLP) libraries: spaCy, NLTK
Web development frameworks: React, express, node.js
Project Roadmap:

The following is a high-level project roadmap:

Phase 1: Data collection and preprocessing.
Phase 2: Template extraction and standardization.
Phase 3: Template comparison and fraud detection.
Phase 4: System integration and deployment.
